[![GoCV](images/gocvlogo.jpg)](https://gocv.io/)

GoCV gives programmers who use the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) access to the [OpenCV 4 computer vision library](http://opencv.org/).

The GoCV package supports the latest releases of Go and OpenCV v4.5.4 on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Our mission is to make the Go language a "first-class" client compatible with the latest developments in the OpenCV ecosystem.

GoCV supports [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) for hardware acceleration using NVIDIA GPUs.

GoCV also supports the [Intel OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) toolkit.
